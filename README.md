# myapp
 A sample node.js web application made to get a hands-on experience on working with Node.js.
 (Focus was on the back-end only, will work on the front-end later))

The application is built on express.js framework. It also uses an postgresql database (using Sequelize Node.js ORM)
to hold all the added emails. The front-end basic pages are made using .pug files. Bootstrap scripts have been added 
but no styling is performed so far. Will add user-auth functionality, front-end styling (and any other cool thing
that I may get to learn) in near future.
